Connection Scope Keepalive for MQTT over QUIC Multi-Stream:

Introduced a new feature to keep MQTT connections alive when data streams are active but contrl stream is quiet.
Previously, clients were required to send MQTT.PINGREQ on idle control streams to keep the connection alive.
A shared state is now maintained for each connection, tracking activity from all streams.
This shared state is used to determine if the connection is still alive, reducing the risk of keepalive timeouts due to Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking.
